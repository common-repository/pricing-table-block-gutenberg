= A new way to WordPress =

We built [CoBlocks](https://coblocks.com?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=coblocks) for the next-generation block editor, codenamed Gutenberg. This new block editor absolutely empowers people to create rich content in such an intuitive fashion.

Building on top of this new foundational change in content creation, CoBlocks leverages Gutenberg to add even more functionality to the block editor. Space out content, drop in social icons, add gifs â€” all of these, and more, are new blocks powered by CoBlocks.

Our vision with CoBlocks is to create content blocks that deliver a first-rate experience for writers, content marketers and publishers.

This plugin is created and maintained by [Rich Tabor](https://richtabor.com?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=coblocks-pricing-table-block).

= Built with developers in mind =

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Then install the [Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/) WordPress plugin. That's it! ðŸ’¥

The new block editor is still very much in active development and is not recommended for production websites just yet.
